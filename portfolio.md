This site is currently being redesigned. Once it's done you will see some of my work here, which consits of:

* Webdesign (jekyll, Blogger, WordPress or Static Jade/HTML)
* Logos (Handwritten or Vector)
* Handlettering (I do post most of that on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/halfapx))
* Fonts
* Fractal Art (I was obsessed with that at some point in my life)

If you've seen something I did and that convinced you to ask if I may be able to help out with your project, please feel free to [contact me](/en/contact) about it.
At the time being I am a full-time student, though so I do have limited capacity and may decline larger project.
If your request is related to handlettering your chances of me finding time for it are really high.
