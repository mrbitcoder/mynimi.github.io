Photosheet is like its sibling [Papersheet](/themes/photosheet) a minimalistic template for people that want to put focus on content. Photosheet was created for blogs that use a lot of imagery, because other than the pictures, you don't get much more on the home page.

This Theme comes with Sass-files that makes adjustments a breeze.
