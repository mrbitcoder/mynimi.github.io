Hearts in Wonderland was supposed to be feminine and playfull. Even if I usually write mostly clean and minimal themes, I might have gone a little too far here, but Hearts in Wondelrand definitely covers all cravings for hearts and pink. ANd if you change the background it might even work for a guy's site.en

Hearts in Wonderland does currently not support the template designer
