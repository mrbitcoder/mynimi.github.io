I reorganized my custom Procreate Brushes.

Easier for both of us and faster to install.

This is gonna be a very small post (haha for once!)

I wanted to take a minute and tell you about my Brush Reorganization.

As you know, I do make a lot of brushes for Lettering on the iPad with Procreate. The thing is, it was kindof annoying to put the freebies online. I always made sets so I couldn't just put up one brush. And the way my website is made, required quite a few things, so updating is not something you do too quickly. Also I didn't really like that the previews were so small and installing was hard.

## Let's make it easier, faster and prettier for both of us
What I did was create a separate website (separate git repo, because I know some of you will know what that is). There I can update the brushes pretty fast.

I wrote out previews for every single brush and created categories, so you are able to sort the view.
My premium brushes are in there too, so you will be able to compare it all.

I got rid of the zip folders. Let's be honest, we all hate extracting and importing manually into procreate. I know I do.
So now all you will download is the brush file. No preview image whatsoever (because let's be honest, you don't look at that anyway). Importing becomes a breeze.

You can see how easy it is in the video below. I demonstrate it with Chrome (the browser App you should all be using on your iPad, if you want to see the web how it's supposed to) and Safari.

Currently there are 55 halfapx Brushes (38 of them for free).
