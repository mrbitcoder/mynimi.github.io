I have been getting quite a few Questions on Instagram on the different ways I film and edit [my lettering videos](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/halfapxletteringvid/). I have been promissing you guys this Post for a while, so here it finally is. I hope this will answer all of your questions and help you guys out.

# Before we jump into it
Okay, so first things first, let's talk about the camera.
Obviously you'll need a smartphone for this and the quality of your videos will depend on this.
I chose my phone based on the camera capabilities when I had to get a new one last year (actually exactly one year ago). The phone I use is the Samsung Galaxy S6. Especially my editing workflow is pretty Samsung specific since I haven't found an editing App that works as nicely as the one that ships with the phone, but I did look for some alternatives and will make some suggestions, also for you iOS guys out there. Okay, let's get on.

# The Helpers
When you first get into Instagram and the whole art/lettering community you will be fascinated by the video quality some people get. Well, some use actual cameras and tripods, I have given this method a try once in a while, but even after getting my beloved Sony a7 II I still use my phone for about 95% of my lettering videos. The reason is simple: I don't like to involve my computer for a video that only lasts a few seconds, and the camera does not allow me to transfer the video files via Wifi.

I will sometimes use Adobe Premiere Pro to edit timelapses, but I will not cover the edit of these videos in this post.

Okay, so let's talk about the actual helpers that make a good Instagram video: "Tripods".

First lesson to learn: Handholding will not help you in the creation of good videos. You will find handheld videos on my account. The reason being that I had an idea and I had to capture it on the go, when I didn't have any access to something to hold up my phone. But actually you can use pretty much anything.
I have found some very cool hacks around the internet.
Just give it a google, it's crazy what people can come up with!

Yet some of the props and actual tripod tools work better than others.
In this guide I want to show you behind the scenes looks of my most used camera angles, and all of these are actually super low budget.

# Desk Setup
Before jumping into lettering consider your desk setup. Obviously we talk table top filming in this post so make sure you have some kind of table, it's best if you have it close to a window where natural light can flow in.
I know, natural light is something I will fight with especially in Winter time. If you are working or a student you will most probably only have time for lettering after dark most of the time but the optimal setting is natural light.
I have two different options in my small one bedroom apartment. An actual desk with the window on the right and a mobile fold-away table that I usually put right in front of my window.
I used to work exclusively on the fold-away table, since my actual desk is my actual work station where I can plug my laptop onto an additional monitor, print stuff and organize work. I kinda changed that after hanging a shelf above my desk. This shelf is now helping in the filming of my overhead shots, which is my favorite camera position, so I will film mostly on my crammed desk now.

Let's get into the actual "tripods" I use.

## Glasses
Yes, you read that right. Before I got any other tool I used to put my phone on a glass. Some glasses work better than others but they will get the job done for small lettering pieces. You will have some of the glass in the picture sometimes, but since Instagram works with square images you can ignore that.
