## the short version
I'm Myriam, 22 years old and from Switzerland. I have a passion (okay, you could call it obsession) for words. Be it in the form of lettering, composing sentences for a story or coding a website. I love pretty pens, awesome technical devices, nail polish and everything related to chocolate.

## the long version
Just read [this blog post](/en/reboot).
