So that's it. The About Page.
You are supposed to present yourself, say what it's all about?

Well, I will give my best...
My name is Myriam.
I have a _slight_ obsession for typing on a computer keyboard. If I'm typing out words for a novel or if code starts to form under my fingers is not that much of a difference to me. I love doing both. With both of them there is one goal. Drawing with words.

Here on halfapx.com I want to combine my passion for writing with my love for code. You'll find here (sometime, hopefully) everything that I write. Sometimes all orderly sometimes a little chaotic. I want to write tutorials. And templates, because I want to create so many designs that I can't use for myself. I'll probably write mostly in and about Sass, jade, sometimes jQuery, obviously HTML and CSS, with a focus on Blogger and jekyll. But you might be going with me on some other adventures as well.

Yeah, I think that's it. Have a look around, read something and stay for a while if you like.
