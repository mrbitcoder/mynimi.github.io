The website for the student organization of the Communications major at the University in Zurich. The page is a simple static website, that was written using jekyll and hosted on GitHub.
It was written with bootstrap as well as some of my own sass.

The task was to design and code the site as well as instructing on how to use the site.

The code is open-sourced and can be [seen here](https://github.com/fvpuk/fvpuk.github.io).
