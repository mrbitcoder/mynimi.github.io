In School we have a course that's basically a wild card. We can do what we want as long as it is related to our subject. I decided to go ahead and create a brush lettering font because I had wanted to do something like this for ages.
I created a whole website for the font. English Version is not out yet. Will be coming soon though.

You can download the font [here](https://goo.gl/SUO5ms). Please check the video below on how to use it. It shows you some tricks so that it looks nice everywhere.
