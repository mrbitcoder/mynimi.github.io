<p>This site has been waiting to be created for a while... while it&#39;s still waiting for some love (and time to be spent on it), here a few projects I did.</p>
<p>I am currently extremely limited with my time, since I study full time and do part-time work as a frontend developer, so I only take on non-coding projects at the moment.</p>
<h1 id="code-work">Code Work</h1>
<p>Coding with Pug, Sass and Javascript is my favorite kind of work. I like simple, static websites when there is no need for fancy sliders, databases and server-side languages like PHP. I like to avoid bloat and keep loading times reasonable. I&#39;ll do WordPress pages when there is the need and choose the static site generator jekyll if the user is ready to learn how to blog like a hacker. I do more coding than design work and will usually collaborate with designers on bigger projects.</p>
<p>I know HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript (preferably jQuery), Git, some PHP, limited SQL.</p>
<h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://GitHub.com/mynimi">halfapx @ GitHub</a></strong></p>
<p>I wrote blogger templates years ago, some jekyll templates, Stylesheet starter pack, and simple jQuery Plugins free to be used.</p>
<h2 id="halfapx-com">halfapx.com</h2>
<p>The site you&#39;re looking at is written and maintained using jekyll. It&#39;s hosted on GitHub, though generated locally using plugins. It features some ruby-powered generators and scripts for automating the publishing process and generating new content. No database behind this site. Every line of code on here is hand-written. No frameworks whatsoever, jQuery, though.</p>
<h2 id="some-other-sites-i-recently-coded-">Some other Sites I recently coded.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://digitalmind.ch/">digitalmind.ch</a></strong> jekyll blog with multiple language support. Using grunt to automate the whole site generating process.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://micheledekker.ch/">micheledekker.ch</a></strong> Also a jekyll blog, using grunt for built processes and hosted on GitHub.</li>

</ul>
<h1 id="photography-lettering-calligraphy">Photography, Lettering, Calligraphy</h1>
<p>I share Lettering and Calligraphy posts multiple Times a day <a href="https://instagram.com/halfapx">@halfapx</a> and some of my mostly macro photography <a href="https://instagram.com/halfapix">@halfapix</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>My Curriculum includes film-making and a creative course where you are asked to come up with Semester projects. Some of the things I did include</p>
<ul>
